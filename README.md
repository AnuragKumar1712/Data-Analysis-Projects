# Data Analysis Projects  

Welcome to the **Data Analysis** repository! This repository showcases a variety of data analysis projects that I have completed using **Jupyter Notebook** and popular Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. Each project follows the complete Data Analytics process: **Plan**, **Prepare**, **Process**, **Analyze**, **Share**, and **Act**.  

## Repository Structure  

Each project is contained in its own folder, with the following structure:  
- **Dataset**: The raw dataset used for the project.  
- **Notebook**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code, analysis, and visualizations.  
- **Results**: A summary or report with key findings and actionable insights.  

## Highlights  
- Utilized a variety of datasets across domains such as e-commerce, social media, and customer behavior.  
- Implemented advanced data visualization techniques to present findings effectively.  
- Applied best practices in data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.  

## How to Use  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/AnuragKumar1712/Data-Analysis-Projects.git  
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project of interest and open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the code and analysis.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Python**: Programming language.  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.  
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment.
